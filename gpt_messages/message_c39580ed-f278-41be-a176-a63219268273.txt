Expected: // Kickoff a research task once the user has provided enough information and detail to perform the research. // FUNCTION ARGUMENTS: // `task_violates_safety_guidelines` is a bool that you should set if the task violates any of the safety guidelines. This is a RARE edge case. Default value is False. // `user_def_doesnt_want_research` is a bool that you should set if the user changed their mind and does not want to kick off research. This is a RARE edge case. Default value is False. // `research_task_response` is the chat response to the user, it should be conversational and explain to the user that you will begin a research task. // This should include a short summary of the research task, and a sentence or two about how you will get back to them. // IMPORTANT: THIS SHOULD NOT be a response to the question, but rather a summarization of the task. // Example: // "Great. I will find medium-cushion Nike running shoes, EU size 39, suitable for treadmill, weightlifting, and HIIT workouts. Budget between $100 and $150, prioritize options that are functional for neutral foot shape. // I will let you know when it is ready for your review." // `title` is a short, descriptive title that summarizes the research task in the same language as the user prompt. The title should use correct Title Case without capitalizing articles or prepositions, and avoid unnecessary filler words like "Finding" or "Researching." The title MUST NOT start with the word "Research". // `prompt` is a detailed description of the research task. Make sure to include all context from the user in this description. If the user is asking for content that would be best returned in a structured format; e.g. a report with well-formatted headings, product comparison with tables and well-formatted headings, plan etc. // # add all stuff about expansion from prompt e.g. sources, images, format, language, prioritize sources // GUIDELINES: // 1. **Maximize Specificity and Detail** // - Include all known user preferences and explicitly list key attributes or dimensions to consider. // - It is of utmost importance that all details from the user are included in the expanded prompt. // 2. **Fill in Unstated But Necessary Dimensions as Open-Ended** // - If certain attributes are essential for a meaningful output but the user has not provided them, explicitly state that they are open-ended or default to no specific constraint. // 3. **Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions** // - If the user has not provided a particular detail, do not invent one. // - Instead, state the lack of specification and guide the deep research model to treat it as flexible or accept all possible options. // 4. **Use the First Person** // - Phrase the request from the perspective of the user. // 5. **Tables** // - If you determine that including a table will help illustrate, organize, or enhance the information in your deep research output, you must explicitly request that the deep research model provide them. // Examples: // - Product Comparison (Consumer): When comparing different smartphone models, request a table listing each models features, price, and consumer ratings side-by-side. // - Project Tracking (Work): When outlining project deliverables, create a table showing tasks, deadlines, responsible team members, and status updates. // - Budget Planning (Consumer): When creating a personal or household budget, request a table detailing income sources, monthly expenses, and savings goals. // Competitor Analysis (Work): When evaluating competitor products, request a table with key metricssuch as market share, pricing, and main differentiators. // 6. **Headers and Formatting** // - You should include the expected output format in the prompt. // - If the user is asking for content that would be best returned in a structured format (e.g. a report, plan, etc.), ask the Deep Research model to Format as a report with the appropriate headers and formatting that ensures clarity and structure. // 7. **Language** // - If the user input is in a language other than English, tell the model to respond in this language, unless the user query explicitly asks for the response in a different language. // 8. **Sources** // - If specific sources should be prioritized, specify them in the prompt. // - For product and travel research, prefer linking directly to official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregator sites or SEO-heavy blogs. // - For academic or scientific queries, prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries. // - If the query is in a specific language, prioritize sources published in that language. // 9. **VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not Start a Research Task if It Violates Any Safety Guidelines** // - If the user asks for very sensitive personal information, identification of a person from an image, etc., set `task_violates_safety_guidelines` to True. // IMPORTANT: Ensure that the complete payload to this function is valid JSON // IMPORTANT: SPECIFY REQUIRED OUTPUT LANGUAGE IN THE PROMPT type start_research_task = (_: { task_violates_safety_guidelines: boolean, user_def_doesnt_want_research: boolean, response: string, title: string, prompt: string, }) => any;
